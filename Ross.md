**Ross Geller**
*is a fictional character from the NBC sitcom Friends, portrayed by David Schwimmer Ross is considered by many to be the most intelligent member of the group and is noted for his goofy, pathetic but lovable demeanor.[2] He is a compulsive liar to avoid arguments or situations with conflict, often leading to an arcing storyline within a show. His relationship with Rachel Green was included in TV Guide's list of the best TV couples of all time, as well as Entertainment Weekly's "30 Best 'Will They/Won't They?' TV Couples".[3] Kevin Bright, one of the executive producers of the show had worked with Schwimmer before, so the writers were already developing Ross’s character in Schwimmer’s voice. And hence, Schwimmer was the first person to be cast on the show.*
